The project involves the following steps:
Data Collection: Gather data on bank customers, including their demographics, account details, and transaction history.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between features.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.

Model Building: Train various machine learning models to predict customer churn and evaluate their performance.

Model Evaluation: Assess the models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.

Deployment: Deploy the model to a production environment where it can be used to make predictions.

Dashboard: Creation of dashboard visual with matplotlib to give more insights on the prediction made by the model
